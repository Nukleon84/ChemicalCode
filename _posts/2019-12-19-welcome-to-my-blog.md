It begins here. An empty Markdown file ready to be filled with my ramblings about computer-aided process engineering (CAPE) and programming. I have been using Github for some years now, but only now have considered to use it beyond "just" sharing code.


## An introduction

Allow me to introduce myself shortly. My name is Jochen and I am a chemical engineer from Germany. After graduating from the TU Dortmund Technical University, I started my professional career at Covestro, a global player in the perfomance polymer market. Currently I am developing the process simulation landscape at Covestro and maintain the inhouse simulator VtPlan.

My passion is computer-aided process engineering, a topic that fascinates me since I started my diploma thesis in 2010. I developed simulation software at the university and continue to do so ever since, both privately and professionaly. I am a big fan of clean-code and try to continuously improve in that regard.

## My Goals

So what do I want to achieve with this project? First, I want to improve my communication about my ongoing projects, so that I can more easily share finding and results from my personal research. Secondly I want to have a place where I can post my opinions on technical topics like digitalization, Industry 4.0, digital enablement and new work.

## My current projects

While I cannot talk much about professional projects, I still have a bit of free time to do some development and research in the evening. Currently I am developing a new, minimalistic process simulation library in .net called MiniSim on [Github](https://github.com/Nukleon84/MiniSim). The idea is to have a lightweight process simulator that can be embedded into other hosting enviroments to create ad-hoc CAPE applications.

In addition I am learning how to use Python, Jupyter and assorted packages to create data science applications on the web.

Last but not least I am interested in Docker, CI/CD and DevOps.
