# Lagrange

Lagrange is a minimalist Jekyll theme for running a personal blog or site for free through [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/), or on your own server. Everything that you will ever need to know about this Jekyll theme is included in the README below, which you can also find in [the demo site](https://lenpaul.github.io/Lagrange/).

### Starting From Scratch

To completely start from scratch, simply delete all the files in the `_posts`, `assets/img`, and `menu` folder, and add your own content. You may also replace the `README.md` file with your own README. Everything in the `_data` folder and `_config.yml` file can be edited to suit your needs. You may also change the `favicon.ico` file to your own favicon.
