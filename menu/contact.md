## Vision

Digitization will fundamentally change the chemical industry. Advances in numerics, cloud computing and machine learning will bring major competitive advantages to those chemical companies adopting the new technologies. My goal is to lead this transformation and, as an interface between IT and process engineering, to enable these companies to develop this potential.

I am a chemical engineer and software developer. My passion is to develop state of the art numerical software for solving challenging process engineering problems. I have recently discovered my love for Python, Data Engineering and Web-Technologies, after years of developing purely for the .net Framework.


My core competencies are:

> Process Simulation <br>
> Scientific Computing <br> 
> Software Engineering <br>
> Problem Solving

## Experience

*2015 - ongoing*

### Expert Process Simulation Software / Covestro Deutschland AG

At Covestro, some highlight projects were:

* Roll-out Manager for the global introduction of a new process simulation tool
* Market and internal demand analysis for the selection of a new process simulationt tool
* Design and testing of a proof-of-concept application platform for simulation tools using Amazon Web Services to show feasibility of cloud computing for process engineering workloads.
* Development and maintenance of the inhouse simulation tool VtPlan
* Training of new process engineers in process simulation and the handling of the available tools

## Education
*2010 - 2015*

### Dr.-Ing. (Chemical Engineering) / TU Dortmund University
I was working at the chair of Process Dynamics and Operations under the supervision of Prof. Sebastian Engell in the scope of the [DFG Sonderforschungsbereich Transregio 63](https://www.inprompt.tu-berlin.de/).
My thesis was titled
[Model-based Conceptual Design and Optimization of Continuous Chemical Processes under Uncertainty](https://www.shaker.de/de/content/catalogue/index.asp?lang=de&ID=8&ISBN=978-3-8440-4844-5) and published in 2016 by Shaker.

*2006 - 2010*
### Diploma (Chemical Engineering) / TU Dortmund University

During my studies, I was working as a student assistant at the chair of Process Dynamics and Operations and supported researchers with programming tasks for scheduling and control topics. In my study project I automated a pipeless plant demonstrator experiment for our student lab using C#, Matlab and LabView.

<br>

*2004 - 2006*
### Vordiplom (Chemistry) / Philipps-University Marburg

Being fascinated with Chemistry in school, I started out my academic path as a chemist. After two years I decided to focus more on industrial applications instead of laboratory research.
